In this project, I'm attempting to create a Library of the books the user is interested in.

Users can enter their favorite books information: 
*The title of the book.
*The author.
*The number of pages.
* Whether the book was read, or not read.

You can delete the book from the library by clicking on the trash button the corresponds with the book you're trying to delete.
You can also switch between the two reading statuses: True and False, where true means the book was read and false means the book hasn't been read or finished yet.
